# WHAT'S TO BECOME OF US ALL??

Zenith Clicker Unabstracted still has many features it has planned, but aren't present. They occupy various categories and levels of priority.

# In-Game UI

## Standard priority
- Exact health
- Damage/heal values
- Attack values
- Live stats (flips/quests/qps/etc, from results)
- ~~Real time~~

## Low priority
- ~~Clock speed~~
- Slowness level (animation length)
- ~~Timer speed displaying "infinite" correctly~~
- Surge cap

# Out-of-game ambiguities

- "YOU DID A THING!" displaying exact badge

# Other

- Progress deletion that doesn't quit the game
