# Zenith Clicker UNABSTRACTED
    This is a modification of MrZ's Zenith Clicker, a TETR.IO Quick Play fangame.
    In Zenith Clicker, your goal is to select the correct cards as denoted by the "quest" that appears on screen.
    However, there's more to the tower than meets the eye... care to see?

    In Unabstracted, many hidden values and mechanics will be shown while you play. If you hadn't learned it from me, you probably never would have known what the "quest buffer" is!
    Right now, the mod is in development, so trying to play won't result in very much difference to the vanilla game. With time, my friend..!
